Many artificial intelligence tasks can be solved by designing the right set of
features to extract for that task, then providing these features to a simple machine
learning algorithm. For example, a useful feature for speaker identification from
sound is an estimate of the size of speakerâ€™s vocal tract. It therefore gives a strong
clue as to whether the speaker is a man, woman, or child.
