== Java "_lang utils_"

By "_lang utils_" I mean utility functions that are so much general purpose,
that they should actually be built in JDK. There are several libraries
like that. None of them is sufficient for everything and every one is
indispensable. Below I justify why.

=== org.apache.commons : `commons-lang3`

* The `ToStringBuilder` offers the feature of `ToStringStyle`
  (e.g. `ToStringStyle.SHORT_PREFIX_STYLE`), which is easily switchable and expressive.



=== org.apache.commons : `commons-collections4`

* `o.a.c.c.CollectionUtils.isEmpty()` - Guava equivalent is not null-safe

* `o.a.c.c.MapUtils.isEmpty()` - Guava equivalent is not null-safe


=== com.google.guava : `guava`

* `ImmutableSet.Builder` - the only way in Java universe to concat 3 sets at once
