* As part of Microsoftâ€™s commitment to responsible AI, custom neural voice is designed
  with the intention of protecting the rights of individuals and society,
  fostering transparent human-computer interaction, and counteracting the proliferation
  of harmful deepfakes and misleading content. For this reason, custom neural voice
  is a Limited Access feature available by registration only, and only for certain use cases.

* Azure AI Speech uses deep neural networks to overcome the limits
  of traditional speech synthesis regarding stress and intonation
  in spoken language. Prosody prediction and voice synthesis happen
  simultaneously, which results in more fluid and natural-sounding outputs.
  Each standard voice model is available at 24 kHz and high-fidelity 48 kHz.
  You can use neural voices to:

* Improve text to speech output with SSML: Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)
  is an XML-based markup language used to customize text to speech outputs.
  With SSML, you can adjust pitch, add pauses, improve pronunciation,
  change speaking rate, adjust volume, and attribute multiple voices
  to a single document.
