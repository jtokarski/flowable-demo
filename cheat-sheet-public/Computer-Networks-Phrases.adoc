* Computer network layers are a conceptual framework used to standardize
  how different technologies and protocols communicate. By dividing the complex process
  of networking into distinct LAYERS, engineers can develop, troubleshoot,
  and scale networks more easily.

* There are two primary models used to explain these layers: the OSI Model
  (a 7-layer theoretical reference) and the TCP/IP Model (a 4-layer practical
  framework used by the actual Internet).

* OSI Model (7 Layers): Layer 7: Application - The interface for end-user software
  (e.g., HTTP for web browsers, SMTP for email).

* OSI Model (7 Layers): Layer 6: Presentation - Translates data into
  a readable format for applications, handling encryption, decryption, and compression.

* OSI Model (7 Layers): Layer 5: Session – Manages the CONVERSATION between devices,
  including starting, stopping, and synchronizing communication sessions.

* OSI Model (7 Layers): Layer 4: Transport – Ensures reliable data transfer between hosts.
  It breaks data into segments and handles error correction and flow control (e.g., TCP, UDP).

* OSI Model (7 Layers): Layer 3: Network – Responsible for routing data across
  different networks using logical addresses (IP addresses). Data at this layer is called packets.

* OSI Model (7 Layers): Layer 2: Data Link – Handles communication
  between devices on the same local network. It packages packets into frames
  and uses physical MAC addresses (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

* OSI Model (7 Layers): Layer 1: Physical – The actual physical medium for transmitting
  raw bits (1s and 0s) over cables, radio waves, or fiber optics.

* TCP/IP Model (4 Layers): Application Layer 4: Combines OSI layers 5, 6, and 7.

* TCP/IP Model (4 Layers): Transport Layer 3: Maps directly to OSI layer 4.

* TCP/IP Model (4 Layers): Internet Layer 2: Equivalent to OSI layer 3 (Network)

* TCP/IP Model (4 Layers): Network Access (or Link) Layer: Combines OSI layers 1 and 2.

* IP routing at Layer 3 (Network Layer) is the process by which data packets are directed
  from a source to a destination across interconnected networks. While Layer 2 (Data Link)
  handles delivery within a single local network using MAC addresses,
  Layer 3 uses logical IP addresses to move data between different subnets
  or across the entire internet.

* Dynamic routing is the automated process where routers exchange information
  to map the network and select the most efficient paths for data. Unlike static routing,
  it allows the network to self-heal by recalculating paths in real-time if a link fails
  or a new router is added.







* Packet-switched networks typically use a strategy called store-and-forward.

* The major reason for using packet switching rather than circuit switching
  in a computer network is efficiency

* In the datagram-forwarding model of packet delivery, packet headers contain
  a destination address. It is up to the intervening switches or routers
  to look at this address and get the packet to the correct destination.
