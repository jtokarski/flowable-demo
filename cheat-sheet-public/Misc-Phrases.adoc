=== Dijkstra range boundary

* Dijkstra argues that [a, b) is the best way to represent a range boundary.
  With the [a, b) range boundary, it is simple to calculate the length of the range,
  the next range, and the edge values of the range. It doesnâ€™t require
  any +1 or -1 adjustments or need a -1 case. +

=== NGRX key concepts

* Actions describe unique events that are dispatched from components and services.

* State changes are handled by pure functions called reducers that take the current state and the latest action to compute a new state.

* Selectors are pure functions used to select, derive and compose pieces of state.

* State is accessed with the Store, *an observable of state and an observer of actions*.

=== PostgreSQL Identity Column

* PostgreSQL version 10 introduced a new constraint GENERATED AS IDENTITY
  that allows you to automatically assign a unique number to a column.
  The GENERATED AS IDENTITY constraint is the SQL standard-conforming variant
  of the good old SERIAL column.
