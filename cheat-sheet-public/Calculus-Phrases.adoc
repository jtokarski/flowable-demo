* Calculus is about functions. I use that word FUNCTIONS in the first sentence, because
  we can't go forward without it.

* The graphs themselves are a straight line and a parabola and an exponential.
  The straight line has constant growth rate. The parabola has increasing growth rate.
  The exponential curve has exponentially increasing growth rate. I emphasize these
  because calculus is all about growth rates.

* The whole point of differential calculus is to discover the growth rate of a function,
  and to use that information. So there are actually two functions in play at the
  same time - the original function and its growth rate.

* The slope is distance up divided by distance across.

* The distance along a curve is the arc length. To set up an integral,
  we break the problem into small pieces. Roughly speaking, small pieces
  of a smooth curve are nearly straight.

* This Poisson model can be derived theoretically or tested experimentally.

* It might not occur to a reasonable person, but sometimes a surface has only one side.
  The famous example is the Möbius strip, for which you take a strip of paper,
  twist it once, and tape the ends together.
