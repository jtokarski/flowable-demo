* Calculus is about functions. I use that word FUNCTIONS in the first sentence, because
  we can't go forward without it.

* The graphs themselves are a straight line and a parabola and an exponential.
  The straight line has constant growth rate. The parabola has increasing growth rate.
  The exponential curve has exponentially increasing growth rate. I emphasize these
  because calculus is all about growth rates.

* The whole point of differential calculus is to discover the growth rate of a function,
  and to use that information. So there are actually two functions in play at the
  same time - the original function and its growth rate.

* The slope is distance up divided by distance across.
