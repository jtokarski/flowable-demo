== Introduction

* Inventors have long dreamed of creating machines that think. This desire dates
  back to at least the time of ancient Greece. The mythical figures Pygmalion,
  Daedalus, and Hephaestus may all be interpreted as legendary inventors, and
  Galatea, Talos, and Pandora may all be regarded as artificial life.
