== Mock SMTP/POP3/IMAP server setup with GreenMail

Theoretically, for running "_standalone_" e-mail server with Greenmail, I should use the *greenmail-standalone* JAR.
But it has some drawbacks:

* `greenmail-standalone` is 10MB while `greenmail` alone is 500kB

* `greenmail-standalone` has to be run as `java -jar` with command line options - not convenient
  for controlling more complex configuration of user accounts, etc.

* `greenmail-standalone` has to be run as `java -jar` so it's not convenient to be run form Gradle module
  with IntelliJ Run configuration

* the only thing that `greenmail-standalone` offers is the REST API, but its very limited for viewing
  or managing e-mail server state

So the optimal solution is to run the `greenmail` within thin Spring Boot web application. And this
is exactly how this project is setup.
