This sub-project is a research on how to use the features of JUnit extension framework.
Primarily for the needs of testing Flowable-based projects that involve using
multiple ProcessEngine(s) in parallel in the same VM.
The main focus is on the fine-grained control over global caching of extension state.

To see the intended results of this demo run *[003] all-junit* configuration. Running
tests individually does not illustrate the working of `HeavyButReusableExtension`.


rozk-todo:
  In contrary to root ExtensionContext what are the lower-level? Test-Class-level?
  Test-Method-level? Or any other differentiation?
