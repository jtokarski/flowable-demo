=== Reactive Web Applications - Spring WebFlux Framework

Important highlights:

* using `spring.webflux.base-path` which makes some problems with Spring Cloud Gateway
  but just for Webflux - works as expected.

* setting the "_welcome pages_" that is `index.html` for some URI paths

* setting handling of static resources

URLs to test:

* http://localhost:8080/noflo/

* http://localhost:8080/noflo/index.html

* http://localhost:8080/noflo/text.txt

* http://localhost:8080/noflo/sapp/

* http://localhost:8080/noflo/sapp/index.html


=== Spring Cloud Gateway

* How to avoid conflicting between e.g. Webflux `/\\**` and Gateway `/api/**` ?
