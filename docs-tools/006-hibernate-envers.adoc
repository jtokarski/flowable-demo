=== Foreword

* initially I wanted to import dependency of `org.defendev.easygo:database` to this project and make
  research starting with pre-existing tables. But since I've discovered that Hibernate schema tooling
  offers possibility to *write DDL to script* instead of making live update, I decided to only use this.
  See `JAKARTA_HBM2DDL_SCRIPTS_ACTION` / `jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action`

* so the main focus is *generating DDLs* from Java `@Entity` classes

* validating the database schema is secondary focus. The only goal here is to prove that
  *Envers adds its own comprehensive validations* on top of pure-Hibernate validations. When that's confirmed,
  I will know that in real projects I can write DDLs manually and use Hibernate+Envers schema validation
  as guardrail (rather than generator).




=== Thoughts on approach

* write multiple persistence units with isolated configuration in this single Gradle subproject
