=== Foreword

* initially I wanted to import dependency of `org.defendev.easygo:database` to this project and make
  research starting with pre-existing tables. But since I've discovered that Hibernate schema tooling
  offers possibility to *write DDL to script* instead of making live update, I decided to only use this.
