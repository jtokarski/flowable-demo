== Research on replacing `@ElementCollection` with `@OneToMany`

=== Motivation

I have two reasons for `@ElementCollection` with `@OneToMany`:

* `@ElementCollection` has performance issues with limited possibility to optimize, as described
  by Vlad Mihalcea:  https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-optimize-unidirectional-collections-with-jpa-and-hibernate/

* `@ElementCollection` feels obscure and over-abstracted. It's not intuitively clear how this should behave
  when using Envers

So, even though this example doesn't involve use of Envers, it's still targeted toward effective use of Envers.
