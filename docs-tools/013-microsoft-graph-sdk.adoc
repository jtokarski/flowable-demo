== Accessing Microsoft Graph APIs with SDK

Based on those manuals:

* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/sdk-installation

* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers?tabs=java - btw.
  note the various kinds of providers beyond `ClientCertificateCredential`, including
  *Integrated Windows provider* which seems to be analogous to using `az login` from CLI.

* https://learn.microsoft.com/pl-pl/graph/sdks/customize-client?tabs=java - on adding
  logging.

It turns out that all the JARs with SDK take over 50MB. It's big because it offers
full functionality of graph manipulation.

But it doesn't seem reasonable to add this to my web application only to fetch
simple list of users.

But maybe it's *worth keeping for reference*, for example to, build some request with
fluent APIs of SDK and then translate it to request URL/headers. For that I need to be able
to log the details of request that GraphServiceClient is doing.
